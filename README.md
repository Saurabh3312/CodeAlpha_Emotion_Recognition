# CodeAlpha Emotion Recognition from Speech

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a model that recognizes emotions in speech audio using deep learning. It uses techniques like MFCC feature extraction to classify emotions like happiness, anger, and sadness from spoken sentences.

## Features
- Audio preprocessing and feature extraction
- Deep learning model training
- Real-time emotion prediction

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Saurabh3312/CodeAlpha_Emotion_Recognition.git
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python src/train_model.py
    ```
4. Test the model:
    ```bash
    python src/test_model.py
    ```

## Usage
- Place audio files in the `data/` directory for training.
- Use the `models/` directory to store trained models.
